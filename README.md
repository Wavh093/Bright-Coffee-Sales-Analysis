## 🧠 1. Planning & Conceptualization (Miro)
I began the project in **Miro**, mapping out the workflow, analysis goals, and slide structure before writing any SQL queries.

**Planning Highlights:**
- Defined objectives and key metrics to analyze (store, product, time, and revenue).
- Drafted SQL query ideas and data transformation steps.
- Outlined presentation story flow: from descriptive → diagnostic → prescriptive insights.

**Outcome:**  
A clear analytical roadmap linking data exploration to business storytelling.

## 🗄️ 2. Data Import & SQL Analysis (Snowflake)
After planning, I imported the raw Bright Coffee CSV dataset into **Snowflake** and built SQL scripts to clean and enrich the data.

**Data Preparation Steps:**
- Standardized columns (transaction_date, store_location, unit_price, transaction_qty).
- Generated new analytical columns

- Performed aggregations and window functions to calculate:
    - Revenue by store
    - Revenue by product category
- Time-based performance (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Weekday vs weekend trends

**Outcome:**
An enriched dataset ready for visualization and KPI analysis.

## 📊 3. Visualization & Pivot Analysis (Excel)

The cleaned Snowflake data was exported to Excel for deeper exploration using pivot tables and charts.

**Excel Tasks:**
**Created Pivot Tables to summarize:**
- Revenue by store
- Revenue by product category
- Revenue by time of day
**Calculated KPIs:**
- Average transaction value
- Total units sold per store
- Product category contribution %

Built Pivot Charts (column, pie, and line) for visual trends.

**Outcome:**
Visually clear dashboards highlighting key business performance drivers.

## 🎨 4. Presentation Design (Canva)

The final presentation deck was designed in Canva, using visuals exported from Excel.

**Canva Steps:**

- Used a clean, coffee-themed layout aligned with the Bright Coffee brand.
- Integrated key charts (store, product, time-of-day trends).
- Added captions and insights derived from SQL and Excel analysis.
- Structured slides around the narrative of “Data → Insight → Action.”

**Outcome:**
A professional presentation titled “Bright Coffee — 2023 Mid-Year Performance Analysis”.
